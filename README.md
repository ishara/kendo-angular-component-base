A starter repository for Kendo UI Angular components, which provides the basic directory structure and dependencies.

## Structure

- The `src` directory contains the component source code. All files should be have the `.jsx` extensions so that the build scripts may pick them.
- The `src/bundle.jsx` file should import and re-export all public components of the package. It is used for the `build-cdn` task.
- The `src/index.jsx` is the main entry point for the NPM package (as specified by the `package.json`). The `build-npm-package` transpiles it to `dist/npm/js/index.js`;
- The `src/kendo-component.jsx` file is the actual sample component implementation.
- The `src/util.jsx` is an optional example of an additional file - you may remove it if unnecessary.

- The `examples` directory hosts the demos for the component. As a bare minimum, the component should have a `basic usage` and a `CDN` example.  The `CDN` example should work as expected after the `build-cdn` task has been run.
- The `test` directory contains the component tests. They are transpiled just like the source code itself, and are run with Jasmine in NodeJS.

- The `docs` directory contains markdown files that document the specifics of the component.

## Usage

- Fork the repository to an appropriately named new one;
- Fork the [theme repository](https://github.com/telerik/kendo-theme-default-base), too.
- Change the package name/description in `package.json`; change the reference to the theme package;
- Change the library name in `gulpfile.js`;
- Change the `src/kendo-component.jsx` file name to something more meaningful;
- Delete the current contents and put something nice in `README.md`.

## Gulp tasks

- `build-npm-package` - builds the scripts and styles in `dist/npm` in CommonJS format;
- `build-cdn` - builds the scripts and styles in `dist/cdn` in UMD format.
- `start` - starts the webpack-dev-server (with browsersync in front of it) - suitable for example preview, development and testing.
- `test` - runs the tests with Jasmine in NodeJS.
- `watch-test` - runs the tests in watch mode.
